# Peripheral Test Modules

This folder contains test modules for various hardware peripherals, primarily focusing on components such as **AD9850**, **MAX262**, **SPI Displays**, **TM1638**, and **DA (Digital-to-Analog)** conversion. The purpose of these test modules is to validate the functionality of these peripherals when integrated with the **ARM Cortex-M4 (TM4C1294)** platform.

## Folder Structure:
The folder includes the following subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific module or version of the tests:

- **AD9850/**: Contains test code for the AD9850 waveform generator module. It includes a basic setup for initializing the module and generating waveforms.
- **MAX262/**: Test code for the MAX262 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) module, verifying its frequency modulation and control features.
- **SPISoftwareDisplay/**: Contains code for testing an SPI-based display, using software-driven SPI communication to display information on the screen.
- **TM1638/**: Includes test code for the TM1638, an 8-digit 7-segment display module, focusing on driving the display and setting up communication.
- **DA/**: Test code for Digital-to-Analog conversion functionality, validating the DA moduleâ€™s ability to output analog signals from digital data.
- **MAX262_v2/**: Test code for a revised version of the MAX262 module (version 2), with updated functionality and performance improvements.
- **SPISoftwareDisplay_old/**: Legacy code for SPI-based display using software-driven SPI communication (older version), maintained for backward compatibility with previous versions of the test system.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the corresponding module's directory.
3. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory's README file (if available) for setup and usage.
4. Ensure that your **ARM Cortex-M4 (TM4C1294)** development environment is properly configured to run these tests.

## Dependencies:
- **ARM Cortex-M4 (TM4C1294)** development board.
- Appropriate libraries and drivers for interfacing with the specified modules.
- Tools such as **Keil uVision** or **IAR Embedded Workbench** for compiling and uploading code to the development board.
